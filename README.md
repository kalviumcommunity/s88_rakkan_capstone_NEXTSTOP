Next Stop Project Plan
Title: NextStop â€“ Travel Planning Web Platform

Description: NextStop is a MERN stack-based web platform that helps users plan customized travel experiences across India. The platform features destination search, personal trip planning based on preferences, discovery of nearby food and accommodations, and a community-driven section where users can share hidden spots. It also includes a future-ready feature allowing verified travel agencies to sell packages with review-based filtering for better trust and planning.

Problem Statement: Despite the availability of multiple travel platforms, users often face difficulty in finding tailored trip plans that match their personal preferences. Many hidden and culturally rich locations remain unexplored due to lack of awareness and visibility. Additionally, users often struggle to find trustworthy tour packages and relevant information in a single, convenient platform. NextStop aims to solve these problems by combining intelligent planning, community sharing, and a reliable marketplace.
